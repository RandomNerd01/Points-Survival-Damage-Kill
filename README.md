# Points-Survival-Damage-Kill
Gives you experience points based off these 3 factors: Survival+Damage+Kill. To work in conjunction with another one of my plugins called Minecraft-Event-Scoreboard https://github.com/Suiron99/Minecraft-Event-Scoreboard



Edit Config.yml to change point multipliers as well as time you want minigame to go on for.
