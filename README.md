# Points-Survival-Damage-Kill

## What it Does
1) Gives you experience points based off these 3 factors: Survival+Damage+Kill. To work in conjunction with another one of my plugins called Minecraft-Event-Scoreboard https://github.com/Suiron99/Minecraft-Event-Scoreboard



2) Edit Config.yml to change point multipliers as well as time you want minigame to go on for.

Gives you points based off survival, kills, damage. Configurable in config. If you want to disable any one of the 3 simply set the one you want to disable to be 0 in config


## How to use it in game


You have to download my Minecraft-Event-Scoreboard plugin. Then before '/battle', admins have to '/startgame'.



1) Use the command '/battle' to start the point acquisition for a period of time




2) After game timer ends, top 5 players will automatically be shown.



3) Admins have to use '/main' to add game points to main leaderboard points.
